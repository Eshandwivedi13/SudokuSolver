# SudokuSolver
The project is a Sudoku solver that aims to replicate the classic experience of solving Sudoku puzzles. Sudoku is a popular number puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9. This program provides a user-friendly interface with features such as a reset button, an exit button, a solution button, and a check moves button.

*Reset Button*: Clears the entire Sudoku grid, allowing you to start fresh.

*Exit Button*: Closes the program.

*Solution Button*: Automatically fills the grid with the correct solutions, giving you a quick answer if needed.

*Check Moves Button*: Verifies the correctness of your current moves and highlights any errors.

The Sudoku grid consists of 9 rows and 9 columns, represented as buttons that you can interact with to input your chosen digits. This Sudoku solver has been built from the ground up to provide an enjoyable and authentic Sudoku-solving experience
